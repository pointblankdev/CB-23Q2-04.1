Title: Designing a User-Friendly Web App for sBTC Stacks-Signers

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a simple, secure, and user-friendly web application for sBTC Stacks-Signers. The web app will enable users to sign transactions related to depositing funds, withdrawing funds, casting votes, and proposing elections. This document outlines the web development process, detailing the top-down bottom-up system design approach.

### Top-down Bottom-up System Design

`The development process will follow a top-down bottom-up system design to ensure a well-structured, efficient, and user-centered product.`

---

### 🔍 Discover Ideal User Access Patterns

- To build a user-friendly application, it is essential to understand the ideal user access patterns. Begin by conducting user research to identify the most common tasks and actions performed by sBTC Stacks-Signers. This will help define the features and functions needed in the application and establish a clear user journey.

### 🎨 Create Initial UI/UX Designs and Gather Feedback

- Based on the user access patterns, create initial UI/UX designs that illustrate the layout and flow of the application. Prioritize simplicity and usability, ensuring that the interface is intuitive and visually appealing. Share these designs with stakeholders and potential users, gathering feedback on the overall design and any potential improvements. Iterate the designs based on the feedback received.

### 📚 Develop Typescript Library Wrapping Stack-Signer via RPC-API

- Once the UI/UX designs are finalized, develop a Typescript library that wraps the Stack-Signer via RPC-API. This library will serve as the foundation for the back-end, enabling communication between the front-end and the Stacks-Signer.

### 👨‍💻 Develop CLI Tool and Write Unit Tests, Gather Feedback

- Develop a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that interacts with the Typescript library and Stack-Signer. This tool will help facilitate testing and debugging during development. Write unit tests for the CLI tool and the Typescript library to ensure their functionality and reliability. Share the CLI tool with stakeholders and gather feedback on its usability and effectiveness.

### 🐋 Develop Docker Image Containing Backend App APIs on Stack-Signer

- Create a Docker image that contains the backend app APIs on the Stack-Signer. This will provide a portable, easy-to-deploy environment for the application, ensuring consistency across different platforms and configurations.

### 💻 Develop Performant Web App UI Consuming Docker Image

- With the backend in place, develop the performant web app UI based on the finalized UI/UX designs. Ensure that the UI communicates seamlessly with the backend via the Docker image, providing a smooth user experience. Optimize the performance of the web app, ensuring that it is responsive and scalable.

### 🧑‍🏫 Write Documentation and Record Video Tutorials

- Finally, create thorough documentation to guide users through the installation, configuration, and use of the web app. This should include step-by-step instructions, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides. In addition, record video tutorials to provide visual aids and further support to users, ensuring they can quickly and easily navigate the application.

## Conclusion

By following this top-down bottom-up system design approach, the development team can create a user-friendly, efficient, and secure web application for sBTC Stacks-Signers. This web app will empower a wider range of users to participate directly in the sBTC Threshold Signature protocol, ultimately promoting decentralization and security within the Stacks network.
